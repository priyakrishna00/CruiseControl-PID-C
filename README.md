# CruiseControl-PID-C
This project simulates a vehicle cruise control system using a PID controller, written in C. It logs speed over time and visualizes the system's response using Python plots. Multiple PID configurations are tested to analyze stability, rise time, and overshoot ideal for embedded and IoT applications.
